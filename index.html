            Overwatch is a team-based shooter game made by Blizzard where players choose from different heroes with unique abilities. Instead of everyone using the same weapons, each character has their own style, like healing teammates, building shields, or dealing high damage. Matches usually involve
            two teams working together to complete objectives, such as pushing a payload or capturing a point. The game is fast-paced and colorful, and teamwork is very important to win.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Overwatch was released in 2016 by Blizzard Entertainment. It was originally created after Blizzard canceled another large project called “Titan.” The development team took ideas from that project and focused on making a team-based multiplayer shooter with unique heroes and strong personality. When Overwatch launched, it became very popular because of its colorful art style, diverse characters, and emphasis on teamwork instead of just individual skill.

            Over the next few years, Blizzard regularly added new heroes,
            maps, and seasonal events, which helped the game grow even more.
            In 2022, Blizzard released Overwatch 2 as a free-to-play sequel.
            The sequel changed the game from 6v6 matches to 5v5 and introduced new
            heroes, updated graphics, and a battle pass system.
            Overwatch has also become a major esport, with professional teams
            competing in the Overwatch League.
