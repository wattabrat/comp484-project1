            Overwatch has many unique support heroes who help their team stay alive and win fights.
            Mercy, Kiriko, and Juno are three strong support characters who each bring something
            different to the battlefield and are my most played heroes in the game.

            Mercy is a main support hero known for her strong healing and ability to revive teammates.
            She uses her <em>Caduceus Staff</em> to either heal allies or boost their damage. Mercy can fly
            quickly to teammates using <em>Guardian Angel</em>, which makes her very mobile and hard to catch.
            Her ultimate ability, Valkyrie, increases her healing and lets her fly freely, making her
            even more powerful during team fights. She is the my most played hero, and the hero I have been able to
            reach Masters rank in competitive play.

          <h3>Kiriko</h3>

          <p>
           
            Kiriko is a fast and flexible support hero. She throws healing ofuda to restore health
            to teammates and can deal critical damage with her kunai. One of her most important
            abilities is Protection Suzu, which makes teammates briefly invulnerable and cleanses
            negative effects. Her ultimate, Kitsune Rush, creates a path that increases movement
            speed and attack speed for her team, helping them push forward aggressively. She also has one of the franchise's best animated shorts, you can watch it

          <h3>Juno</h3>
          
          <p>
            
            Juno is a newer support hero who focuses on mobility and utility. She can move quickly
            around the map and support teammates from different positions. Juno provides healing
            while also helping control space during fights. Her abilities allow her to assist her
            team while staying safe and repositioning easily, making her a valuable support option
            in many team compositions.
