          <h3>How Overwatch works</h3>
          <p>
            Overwatch is a team-based shooter where two teams fight over objectives instead of just
            getting the most eliminations. Each team uses a mix of roles—Tank, Damage, and Support—
            and teamwork usually matters more than any single player’s aim.

          <h3>Core objective</h3>
          <p>
            Every match is built around a main goal, like capturing a point or pushing a payload.
            Teams win by completing the objective before time runs out, or by stopping the other team
            from finishing theirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective is always shown on the screen, and most fights happen right around it.
            A smart team knows when to group up, when to push forward, and when to back up and reset.

          <h3>Roles: Tank, Damage, Support</h3>
          <p>
            Teams usually work best when they have a balanced group of roles. Tanks create space and
            protect teammates. Damage heroes try to secure eliminations and pressure the enemy.
            Supports keep the team alive with healing and utility, like cleansing, speed boosts, or
            saving teammates during big fights.
          </p>

            <h4>Quick Tip</h4>
            <p>
              If your team is losing fights, try grouping up before re-engaging. Going in one-by-one
              usually feeds the enemy team free eliminations.

          <h3>Ultimates and team fights</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimates are powerful abilities that charge over time through healing, damage, and
            other actions. Many matches are decided by how well teams manage ultimates. Using multiple
            ultimates together can win a fight quickly, but wasting them can lose the next fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            A typical “team fight” happens when most players from both teams are alive and battling
            near the objective. Winning one clean team fight often leads to objective progress.

          <h3>Positioning and map control</h3>
          <p>
            Positioning is where you stand and why. Holding high ground can be stronger than standing
            on the point, and using cover helps you survive. Map control also matters, if your team
            controls key areas, you can force the enemy into bad angles and make their pushes harder.
          </p>

          <h3>What makes Overwatch different</h3>
          <p>
            Overwatch isn’t just about aim. It’s about choosing the right heroes, playing as a team,
            and using abilities at the right time. When everything clicks, good grouping, smart ult
            usage, and strong teamwork—matches feel fast, intense, and really fun.
